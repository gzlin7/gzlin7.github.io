				<div class="title">Fog on the Charles</div>
				<p> My sophomore year dorm room in <a
					href="http://mccormick.mit.edu/node/29" target="McC">McCormick Hall</a> had an amazing view of the Charles River. No matter how
					stressful things got at school, the tranquil view from my window never failed to make everything a
					little brighter. When I came home for winter break, I painted the nighttime view (bottom image).
				</p>
				<p>
					I was pleased with how the water and sky turned out, but felt I could do better with the
					composition and colors. At the end of the following semester, I redrew the Boston skyline as viewed
					from ground level rather than eighth-floor penthouse, this time paying special attention to colors and composition. I
					drew inspiration from the mesmerizing skyline paintings of one of my favorite artists, Ronald Kuang (<a
						href="https://www.instagram.com/seerlight/?hl=en" target="ronald">@seerlight</a>), whose palettes and work are exquisite. Equally exquisite is the work of Wenqing Yan 
					(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/yuumeiart/?hl=en" target="yuumei">@yuumeiart</a>), another of my favorite artists. I used Yuumei's digital cloud brushes in both of these paintings.
