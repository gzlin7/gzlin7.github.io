				<div class="title">Dormspam: “Techxodus”</div>
				<p>From January to March 2020, I drew a biweekly comic strip, Dormspam, published in <a
						href="https://thetech.com/" target="ttt">The Tech</a>.
					Much like the short-lived Spring 2020 semester, what started out as lighthearted doodles became
					depressing sketches on the state of campus. The final comic, “Techxodus,” was drawn days after 
					evacuating MIT due to COVID-19. Dormspam subsequently went on hiatus.
				</p>
				<p>The title Dormspam comes from an MIT colloquialism** for sending an email to the mailing
					lists of all dorms. Sometimes satire and often times club event ads, dormspam (and the flame wars
					it can incite) is uniquely
					MIT, much like the niche humor I aimed for in the Dormspam comic, which made fun of topics such as
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_class_ring" target="brassrat">Brass Rat</a>, <a
						href="https://xfair.io/" target="xfair">XFair</a>, <a
						href="https://thetech.com/photos/9372" target="purell">Purell dispensers</a>, and <a
						href="https://www.facebook.com/beaverconfessions/posts/2006248752777495"
						target="tetazoo">tetazoo glounge</a>.
				</p>
				<p>One rule for sending dormspam is that the sender must close the message by indicating the color of
					his or her underwear. Or any color, really. I've tried to pay homage to this tradition
					in the artist's signatures of Dormspam comics. I hope to continue Dormspam sometime in the future, when I'm feeling more inspired.
				</p>
				<p> **To my knowledge, “dormspam” is both a verb and a noun.
