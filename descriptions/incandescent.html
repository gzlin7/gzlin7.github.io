				<p>I had been interested in <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/about.html"
					target="borderline">Borderline</a>, a student organization responsible for the AR-animated murals in
					the tunnels under MIT, ever since seeing a <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/blog.html#CPW"
					target="cpw">Borderline AR demo at Campus Preview Weekend</a>. During
					freshman fall, I applied to paint and animate a mural with Borderline. The design was based on a
					piece I did in high school (below) and the idea that people are like lightbulbs: they burn bright
					with ideas and shine on each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before working on Incandescent, I had never painted a mural nor done animation, but Borderline
					provided me with the supplies and training I needed. The mural took about a week to complete, and if
					I’m being honest, it turned out pretty different from what I had envisioned. I have mixed feelings
					towards Incandescent now, but I am satisfied with how the AR animation turned out. I’m
					grateful to Borderline for this opportunity to share my art, and I have since joined the Borderline exec
					team to help continue the tunnel and other Borderline projects.
