				<i>A small zine about big changes and <br> growing pains that cut deeper than a knife. </i>
				<br><br>
				<p>I thought the weeks in between
					submitting my master's thesis and beginning full-time work in NYC would offer some peaceful respite and time
					to reflect...
				</p>
				<p> On Friday night, I turned in my thesis, and on Saturday morning, I was virtually touring potential
					apartments with my future roommate. The hectic but mundane whirlwind of life events-- apartment hunting (read
					the fine print!); an involved team-matching process for my job; and cramming as many goodbye lunches/dinners
					with friends at school-- was itself a full-time job. Although perfectly manageable, it left no space to
					breathe and relax.
					Fortunately, I didn't feel awfully sentimental because this entire year was a slow burn goodbye to MIT, and I
					already got to spend
					longer than I had anticipated at school and with dear friends; it was about time to graduate and move on.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					Then things got worse. Difficult family circumstances arose which caused me to decide not to return home as
					planned. Consequently, for the first time in my life, I had to worry about
					having a place to sleep. Scrambling to figure out my own moving and housing logistics, I put aside my own
					feelings and the pain of a severed tie, tolerating a semi-regular stream of words, actions, and accusations
					that cut deeper than a knife. My life became almost absurd, forcing myself to maintain a bubbly
					demeanor in front of friends and future bosses and colleagues, while under the surface, I was helplessly
					drowning.
				</p> -->
				<p>
					Then things got worse. Difficult family circumstances (too personal to disclose) arose which caused me to worry
					about my moving and housing logistics, on top of being emotionally distressed to the point of affecting my physical health.
					Once my situation became a little more stable, owing to the generosity of my friends and support system at
					school, I began to draw, because "drawing is free therapy," as someone wrote on the wall of my floor
					kitchen. And it is. I spent two days feverishly drawing Liminal Space, finding comfort and satisfaction in the
					familiar
					lines, colors, and shapes. <b>I wanted to turn the ugliness and chaos of my personal life into something
						beautiful and orderly, and I didn't want to think about anything else. </b>I kept the art intentionally
					general, afraid to expose anything private, disturbing, or
					vindictive. I hardly allude to the root cause of my distress and focus instead on the generic uncertainty of
					post-college transition.
				</p>
				<p>
					And I think the generality of Liminal Space allowed it to strike a chord with surprisingly many people, with
					even acquaintances and strangers leaving comments online. I couldn't care less how my art fares on social
					media, but I'm glad that something born from such a
					terrible experience could bring others joy or comfort.
