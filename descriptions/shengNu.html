				<div class="title">剩女 (shèng nǚ)</div>
				<p>Based on the Chinese concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_nu"
						target="shengNu">剩女 (“leftover” women)</a> and <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate" target="redThread">姻缘红线 (Red Thread of
						Fate)</a>, this piece challenges the idea that a woman’s value lies in marriage. Usually tied around the
					pinky, the Red Thread supposedly connects soulmates, i.e. marriage partners, yet the subject’s Red
					Thread is severed to indicate that marriage is choice, not destiny. The thread entangling the subject
					represents the confines placed on women by societal and cultural expectations to be
					obedient caretakers and homemakers and nothing else. Having been labeled a 剩女, the subject stares
					into the eyes of the observer, unfazed.</p>
				<p>I have nothing against marriage and was simply intrigued (and disturbed) by the 剩女 concept. I decided
					to paint this on a whim while procrastinating. Additionally, I had been wanting to explore using
					Red Thread and Chinese calligraphy as themes in a piece, and everything sort of converged into
					this. It is not a self-portrait.</p>
