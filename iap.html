      <a target="m" href="https://web.mit.edu/iap/">Independent Activities Period (IAP)</a> is MIT's January term where
      students can take classes, enter competitions, work externships, teach abroad (pre-COVID), or just chill.
      In a way, IAP is an extension of winter break: a time for doing nothing, yet the perfect time to do everything you
      are too hosed
      to do during a normal semester. Well, I might have taken "do everything" a bit too literally... project dump
      below! (update: oops it is now April 2021 and I still haven't finished this blog post. Pokerbots and CogSci Paper sections
      are still WIPs but the rest of the blog is finished!)

      This IAP, I took Pokerbots (6.176), a student-run IAP class. According to their <a href="https://pokerbots.org/"
        target="pkr">website</a>, Pokerbots
      “is a computerized poker
      tournament. Teams have one month to program a completely autonomous pokerbot to compete against other teams.”
      Having very minimal poker knowledge, I was prepared
      to declare the endeavor successful if I saw
      any incremental improvement in my poker abilities through this class.
      Every year, the class introduces some variant of Heads-Up No-Limit Hold’em as the game being played. This year’s
      variant, “No-Limit Blotto
      Hold’em,” featured the following twist (below), which adds complexity via hole formation and board allocation
      strategy,
      and tightens the expected starting hand ranges per board.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post">
      <i>"The main modification is that players are dealt 6 cards and have to form three poker hands across three
        playing
        boards, instead of the normal 2 cards played on one board. Each board is resolved separately, with the 12 dealt
        cards drawn without replacement from a 52 card deck and the board cards drawn independently from the remaining
        40
        cards. At the start of each hand, the boards are inflated with 1, 2, and 3 big blinds, with players choosing
        which
        pair of hole cards to send to each of the three boards preflop."</i>

      With my amazing and artistic friends Audrey, Margaret, and Penny, we started <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/big_dijkstra_energy/" target="bde">Big Dijkstra Energy (BDE)</a>, a webcomic
      of CS and math puns/pickup lines in December, inspired by MIT Confessions. Over IAP, we held a pickup lines
      tournament for Bad Ideas Weekend
      (100+
      submissions and 75+ Zoom attendees OwO), collaborated with MIT Mind Hand Heart Innovation Fund on a special
      surprise for returning
      undergraduates (making 2000+ Valentine's day postcards!), and were invited to take over the official <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/mitadmissions/" target="admissions">@mitadmissions</a> Instagram for Valentine’s
      Day week! <a href="https://mindhandheart.mit.edu/blog/bad-puns-good-times-big-dijkstra-energy" target="mhh_">We
        wrote a lengthy and ~emo~ blog post for Mind Hand Heart (that brought me to tears) about BDE’s
        conception, projects, and
        impact</a>. I don't think my words could do the project as much justice as the eloquence of Audrey and everyone
      else, so read the blog post! Here's a small snippet (from the blog) of my own thoughts and feels: <br><br>
      <i>Big Dijkstra Energy combines all of my favorite things-- art, MIT Confessions, and CS (in some sense, haha)--
        and
        I'm eternally grateful to have amazing, talented, like-minded friends who are also excited to do a project like
        BDE. It's like we really share the same wavelength (or brain cell, or circus), and our group calls have really
        helped me get through these last few months of remote learning &lt;3. I've also been surprised at the amount of
        interest that the comic has garnered, in and outside of the MIT community. Perhaps there's some truth to the
        lonely CS nerd stereotype (oops!), but in these weird and isolating times, we need all the love we can get, and
        I
        can't think of a project I've worked on in my last 2.5 years at MIT that embodies the camaraderie, spontaneity,
        and quirkiness of the 'tvte as much as BDE.

      <span class="subsubheading"> UA CovidHack</span><br>
      From January 8-10th, MIT Undergraduate Association (UA) ran an <a href="http://ua.mit.edu/covid-hack"
        target="hack">ideas hackathon</a> to crowdsource proposals
      for COVID-safe improvements to campus life in the spring, focusing on four tracks: outdoor spaces, virtual
      community, remote
      learning, and policy awareness. The pitches were presented to administrators, with the guarantee that the winners
      from each track would be implemented come spring. Like most of the 100+ teams that entered, my friend Penny and I
      were baited by the complimentary Hydroflasks promised to all teams who submit a pitch. During team formation, we
      were joined by a wonderful new friend, Daniel. Though all three of us had signed up just for the
      Hydroflasks, we ended up going hard and spending our <i>entire</i> Saturday (submitted at 5am ET…) on refining our
      proposal and crafting our pitch, below, which was heavily inspired by a similar system that I used during my
      internship at Two Sigma to opt into weekly Slack calls with up to 5 other interns or full-timers. We didn't end up
      winning,
      but I'm really happy with how the final submission came out, and I am one friend (and Hydroflask) richer for
      it.<br>

      Here are our <a

      <span class="subsubheading"> Borderline</span><br>
      One of my dearest clubs, <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/" target="borderline">Borderline</a> has had a busy
      IAP. In addition to other side projects and workshops, we have been
      focusing on designing a mural installation for an enormous 30’ x 7’ Story Wall in MIT’s newly built <a
        href="https://spectrum.mit.edu/fall-2018/welcome-to-kendall-square/" target="kws">Kendall Square
        Welcome Center</a>, including a lot of iteration and back-and-forth meetings with MIT administrators. I'm so
      excited
      that, after a year, Borderline will be able to paint murals once again this spring :D
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post">
      More recently, I've been working with my Co-Publicity directors, Philena and Yiming, to redesign Borderline's
      websites, including the <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/" target="bdl">main site</a> and
      <a href="http://tunnel.mit.edu/" target="t66">Tunnel66</a>. Changes to Tunnel66 have been finished, including a
      redesign of the header room, and the option to filter by dorm.
      We hope these changes will allow the site to be used as a platform for MIT undergraduates to feel more connected
      to their neighbors outside the pod system, and once again showcase dorm culture for c/o 2025 prefrosh this
      upcoming Campus Preview Weekend/CP*.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      We applied the same toggle/filtering logic to make the <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/murals.html"
        target="murals">murals</a>
      on our main site selectable by year, and redesigned our <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/"
        target="bdl">main/splash page</a> to be more informative, flattening the page hierarchy of the site and making
      it easier to navigate! Though the changes may be subtle, I have much more peace-of-mind knowing these
      improvements have been made :)

      <span class="subsubheading"> Mystery Hunt</span><br>
      According to their <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/" target="mystery">website</a>, “The MIT Mystery Hunt is a
      puzzlehunt competition that takes place on the MIT campus every year during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
      weekend. The hunt challenges each participating team to solve a large number of puzzles which lead to an object
      (called a “coin”) hidden somewhere on campus.” The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Mystery_Hunt"
        target="mystwiki">Wikipedia page</a> provides a more comprehensive description of the
      competition and its rich history. The puzzles are quite challenging and extremely well thought out, stacking
      layers of complexity and hidden meanings in the form of logic puzzles, riddles, and metas. This year's hunt
      featured over 170
      puzzles, but what stood out to me even more was the platform: due to COVID, Mystery Hunt 2021 had the unique
      challenge of being entirely virtual,
      whereas Mystery Hunts of the past were on-campus events which had teams exploring MIT campus and solving some of
      the puzzles (which required physical props/setup) in person.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This year's organizers (<a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/two-hundred-puzzles/" target="galactic">✈✈✈
        Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈</a>: the winning team of the previous year's Mystery Hunt, as
      per tradition) more than rose to the challenge; really, they exceeded all my expectations.
      They recreated an alternate-universe MIT (⊥IW- Perpendicular Institute of the World) as an MMO game which
      integrated with the puzzles nicely; the interactivity, explorability, creativity, and attention to detail
      of the world they built is truly astounding. But don't take my word for it, you can  <a
        href="https://perpendicular.institute/" target="perp">check out ⊥IW yourself here</a>!
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Though I'm very much a puzzlehunt novice, I was fortune that my friend Mindren invited me to join the team NES,
      started last year by some MIT Next House residents. The team was fairly large and included some seasoned puzzlehunt
      veterans and huge brains. At least one member has written his own puzzlehunts, one of which Mindren and I did later in IAP. NES used Discord to 
      collaborate on puzzles throughout the weekend, and maybe I'm just a Discord noob, but I was blown away by how streamlined and efficient the NES Discord was.
      Audio channels were created for each puzzle, so you could see what puzzles other people were actively working on when you
      hopped on. Discord bots automatically created Google Docs for new puzzles, and you could ping Discord to tag puzzles and 
      puzzlers. Though I solved very few puzzles myself, I had a great time, and NES ended up solving over 170 puzzles and finishing in 15th place!
