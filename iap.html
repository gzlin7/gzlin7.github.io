      <a target="m" href="https://web.mit.edu/iap/">Independent Activities Period (IAP)</a> is MIT's January term where
      students can take classes, enter competitions, work externships, teach abroad (pre-COVID), or just chill.
      In a way, IAP is an extension of winter break: a time for doing nothing, yet the perfect time to do everything you
      are too hosed
      to do during a normal semester. Well, I might have taken "do everything" a bit too literally... project dump
      below!

      Pokerbots (6.176) is a student-run IAP class. According to their site, Pokerbots “is a computerized poker
      tournament. Teams have one month to program a completely autonomous pokerbot to compete against other teams.”
      Every year, the class introduces some variant of Heads-Up No-Limit Hold’em. This year’s variant, “No-Limit Blotto
      Hold’em,” featured the following twist, which adds complexity via hole formation and board allocation,
      and tightens the expected starting hand ranges per board.<br><br>
      <i>"The main modification is that players are dealt 6 cards and have to form three poker hands across three
        playing
        boards, instead of the normal 2 cards played on one board. Each board is resolved separately, with the 12 dealt
        cards drawn without replacement from a 52 card deck and the board cards drawn independently from the remaining
        40
        cards. At the start of each hand, the boards are inflated with 1, 2, and 3 big blinds, with players choosing
        which
        pair of hole cards to send to each of the three boards preflop."</i>

      With my amazing and artistic friends Audrey, Margaret, and Penny, we started <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/big_dijkstra_energy/" target="bde">Big Dijkstra Energy (BDE)</a>, a webcomic
      of CS and math puns/pickup lines in December. Over IAP, we held a pickup lines tournament for Bad Ideas Weekend
      (100+
      submissions and 75+ Zoom attendees OwO), collaborated with MIT Mind Hand Heart Innovation Fund on a special
      surprise for returning
      undergraduates, and were invited to take over the official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mitadmissions/"
        target="admissions">@mitadmissions</a> Instagram for this special Valentine’s
      Day week! We wrote a lengthy and ~emo~ blog post for Mind Hand Heart (that brought me to tears) about BDE’s
      conception, projects, and
      impact, which I’ll link once it’s published this week, but for now, here are my personal
      reflections: <br><br>
      <i>Big Dijkstra Energy combines all of my favorite things-- art, MIT Confessions, and CS (in some sense, haha)--
        and
        I'm eternally grateful to have amazing, talented, like-minded friends who are also excited to do a project like
        BDE. It's like we really share the same wavelength (or brain cell, or circus), and our group calls have really
        helped me get through these last few months of remote learning &lt;3. I've also been surprised at the amount of
        interest that the comic has garnered, in and outside of the MIT community. Perhaps there's some truth to the
        lonely CS nerd stereotype (oops!), but in these weird and isolating times, we need all the love we can get, and
        I
        can't think of a project I've worked on in my last 2.5 years at MIT that embodies the camaraderie, spontaneity,
        and quirkiness of the 'tvte as much as BDE.

      <span class="subsubheading"> UA CovidHack</span><br>
      From January 8-10th, MIT Undergraduate Association (UA) ran an <a href="http://ua.mit.edu/covid-hack"
        target="hack">ideas hackathon</a> to crowdsource proposals
      for COVID-safe improvements to campus life in the spring, focusing on four tracks: outdoor spaces, virtual
      community, remote
      learning, and policy awareness. The pitches were presented to administrators, with the guarantee that the winners
      from each track would be implemented come spring. Like most of the 100+ teams that entered, my friend Penny and I
      were baited by the complimentary Hydroflasks promised to all teams who submit a pitch. During team formation, we
      found a wonderful third member for our team, Daniel. Though all three of us had signed up just for the
      Hydroflasks, we ended up going hard and spending our ENTIRE Saturday (submitted at 5am ET…) on refining our
      proposal and crafting our pitch, below, which was heavily inspired by a similar system at Two Sigma that
      I used this summer to opt into weekly Slack calls with up to 5 other interns or full-timers. We didn't end up
      winning,
      but I'm really happy with how the final submission came out, and I am one friend (and Hydroflask) richer for
      it.<br>

      Here are our <a

      <span class="subsubheading"> Borderline</span><br>
      One of my dearest clubs, <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/" target="borderline">Borderline</a> has had a busy
      IAP. In addition to other side projects and workshops, we have been
      focusing on designing a mural installation for an enormous 30’ x 7’ Story Wall in MIT’s newly built Kendall
      Welcome Center, including a lot of iteration and back-and-forth meetings with MIT administrators. I'm so excited
      that, after a year, Borderline will be able to paint murals once again this spring :D
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post">
      More recently, I've been working with my Co-Publicity directors, Philena and Yiming, to redesign Borderline's
      websites, including the main site and
      <a href="http://tunnel.mit.edu/" target="t66">Tunnel66</a>. Changes to Tunnel66 have been finished, including a
      redesign of the main room and the option to filter by dorm.
      We hope these changes will allow the site to be used as a platform for MIT undergraduates to feel more connected
      to their neighbors outside the pod system, and once again showcase dorm culture for c/o 2025 prefrosh this
      upcoming Campus Preview Weekend/CP*.
