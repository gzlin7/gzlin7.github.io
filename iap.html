      <span class="subsubheading"> Pokerbots [WIP]</span><br>
      This IAP, I took <a href="https://pokerbots.org/" target="pkr">6.176 Pokerbots</a>, a student-run IAP class.
      According to their site, Pokerbots
      “is a computerized poker
      tournament. Teams have one month to program a completely autonomous pokerbot to compete against other teams.”
      Having very minimal poker knowledge, I was prepared
      to declare the endeavor successful if I saw
      any incremental improvement in my poker abilities through this class.
      Every year, the class introduces some variant of Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold’em poker as the game being played.
      This year’s
      variant, <a href="https://github.com/mitpokerbots/class-resources-2021/blob/main/Blotto%20Hold'em.pdf"
        target="blotto_poker"> No-Limit Blotto
        Hold’em</a>, featured the following twist, which adds complexity via hole formation and board allocation
      strategy,
      and tightens the expected starting hand ranges per board.
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post">
      <i>"The main modification is that players are dealt 6 cards and have to form three poker hands across three
        playing
        boards, instead of the normal 2 cards played on one board. Each board is resolved separately, with the 12 dealt
        cards drawn without replacement from a 52 card deck and the board cards drawn independently from the remaining
        40
        cards. At the start of each hand, the boards are inflated with 1, 2, and 3 big blinds, with players choosing
        which
        pair of hole cards to send to each of the three boards preflop."</i>
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post">
      The class provided <a href="https://github.com/mitpokerbots/class-resources-2021/"
      target="poker_ghub"> basic skeleton poker bots</a> and a scrimmage server to upload and test bots against each
      other. The class lectures taught basic poker strategy and bot improvements, including finding Nash
      equilibria/counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) and how to
      leverage computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations
      to evaluate hand strength. Python bots used the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/eval7/" target="eval7">eval7 hand evaluation library</a>. Beyond obvious bot improvements, my
      pokerbots partner Jacob and I tried numerous heuristics for card evaluation and even threw a neural net (albeit at
      the last minute) at the problem, all in vain, settling on our best-performing bot that played aggressively with
      tight bets, for the final tournament. Still, we ended placing 11th out of 110! The second place team coded the recommended Nash optimal strategy, while the first place team implemented a more exploitative strategy to gauge the opponent's
      strategy and hand strength in order to counter play and bluff effectively.
      Their strategy factored in the opponent's <a href="https://pokercopilot.com/poker-statistics/vpip-pfr" target="vpip">pre-flop raise (PFR) and voluntarily put in pot (VPIP)</a> stats to gauge opponent
      tendencies and dynamically adjust bluffing; they took advantage of eval7's equity calculator to simulate hand
      strength more effectively by considering opponent hand ranges; and they sized bets appropriately to make pot odds
      calculations seem favorable to bait opponents into betting on weaker hands.

      For our 9.66 project, Joie, Arwa, and I designed and conducted <a

      comparing SIPS goal inference with human goal inference in the presence of planning agent mistakes. Over IAP, we
      continued
      working on the experiments and writing up our work in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13249"
        target="arXiv">paper submission</a> to the <a href="https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci-2021/"
        target="cogsci">2021 CogSci Conference</a>. In our work
      (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13249" target="arXiv">published on arXiv</a>), we define
      three categories of mistakes (goals, plans, actions),
      incorporating them into SIPS as various types of noise and designing observation trajectories exhibiting the three
      types of mistakes in the two planning domains. With these observation stimuli, we conducted Mturk
      experiments to compare human goal inference with SIPS goal inference, developing experiment interfaces
      (AngularJS + Firebase webapp) to present the stimuli for both domains, collect inferred goal probabilities, and
      quality check that
      participants understand their task. The results of our experiments demonstrated that in both planning domains, our
      modified SIPS model better explains human inferences than alternative models. </p>

      <span class="subsubheading"> Big Dijkstra Energy</span><br>
      With my amazing and artistic friends Audrey, Margaret, and Penny, we started <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/big_dijkstra_energy/" target="bde">Big Dijkstra Energy (BDE)</a>, a webcomic
      of CS and math puns/pickup lines in December, inspired by MIT Confessions. Over IAP, we held a pickup lines
      tournament for <a href="http://bad-ideas.mit.edu/calendar.html" target="lad">Bad Ideas Weekend</a>
      (100+
      submissions and 75+ Zoom attendees 😳), collaborated with MIT Mind Hand Heart Innovation Fund on a special
      surprise for returning
      undergraduates (making 2000+ Valentine's day postcards!), and were invited to take over the official <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLC9qk_nQqI/" target="admissions">@mitadmissions Instagram</a> for Valentine’s
      Day week! We
      wrote a <a href="https://mindhandheart.mit.edu/blog/bad-puns-good-times-big-dijkstra-energy" target="mhh_">thicc
        and ~emo~ blog post </a>for Mind Hand Heart (brought me to tears) about BDE’s
      conception, projects, and
      impact. I don't think my words could do BDE as much justice as the eloquence of Audrey and everyone
      else, so read the blog post! Here's a small snippet (from the blog) of my own thoughts and feels: <br> <a

      <i>Big Dijkstra Energy combines all of my favorite things-- art, MIT Confessions, and CS (in some sense, haha)--
        and
        I'm eternally grateful to have amazing, talented, like-minded friends who are also excited to do a project like
        BDE. It's like we really share the same wavelength (or brain cell, or circus), and our group calls have really
        helped me get through these last few months of remote learning &lt;3. I've also been surprised at the amount of
        interest that the comic has garnered, in and outside of the MIT community. Perhaps there's some truth to the
        lonely CS nerd stereotype (oops!), but in these weird and isolating times, we need all the love we can get, and
        I
        can't think of a project I've worked on in my last 2.5 years at MIT that embodies the camaraderie, spontaneity,
        and quirkiness of the 'tvte as much as BDE.

      <span class="subsubheading"> UA CovidHack</span><br>
      From January 8-10th, MIT Undergraduate Association (UA) ran an <a href="http://ua.mit.edu/covid-hack"
        target="hack">ideas hackathon</a> to crowdsource proposals
      for COVID-safe improvements to campus life in the spring, focusing on four tracks: outdoor spaces, virtual
      community, remote
      learning, and policy awareness. The pitches were presented to administrators, with the guarantee that the winners
      from each track would be implemented come spring. Like most of the 100+ teams that entered, my friend Penny and I
      were baited by the complimentary Hydroflasks promised to all teams who submit a pitch. During team formation, we
      were joined by a wonderful new friend, Daniel. Though all three of us had signed up just for the
      Hydroflasks, we ended up going hard and spending our <i>entire</i> Saturday (submitted at 5am ET…) on refining our
      proposal and crafting our pitch, below, which was heavily inspired by a similar system that I used during my
      internship at Two Sigma to opt into weekly Slack calls with up to five other interns or full-timers. We didn't end
      up
      winning,
      but I'm really happy with how the final submission came out, and I am one friend (and Hydroflask) richer for
      it.<br>

      One of my dearest clubs, <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/" target="borderline">Borderline</a> has had a busy
      IAP. In addition to other side projects and workshops, we have been
      focusing on designing a mural installation for an enormous 30’ x 7’ Story Wall in MIT’s newly built <a
        href="https://spectrum.mit.edu/fall-2018/welcome-to-kendall-square/" target="kws">Kendall Square
        Welcome Center</a>, including a lot of iteration and back-and-forth meetings with MIT administrators. I'm so
      excited
      that, after a year, Borderline will be able to paint murals once again this spring :D
    </p>

    <p class="blog-post">
      More recently, I've been working with my Co-Publicity directors, Philena and Yiming, to redesign Borderline's
      websites, including the <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/" target="bdl">main site</a> and
      <a href="http://tunnel.mit.edu/" target="t66">Tunnel66</a>. Changes to Tunnel66 have been finished, including a
      redesign of the header room, and the option to filter by dorm.
      We hope these changes will allow the site to be used as a platform for MIT undergraduates to feel more connected
      to their neighbors outside the pod system, and once again showcase dorm culture for c/o 2025 prefrosh this
      upcoming Campus Preview Weekend/CP*.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      We applied the same toggle/filtering logic to make the <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/murals.html"
        target="murals">murals</a>
      on our main site selectable by year, and redesigned our <a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/"
        target="bdl">main/splash page</a> to be more informative, flattening the page hierarchy of the site and making
      it easier to navigate! Though the changes may be subtle, I have much more peace-of-mind knowing these
      improvements have been made :)

      <span class="subsubheading"> Mystery Hunt</span><br>
      According to their <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/" target="mystery">website</a>, “The MIT Mystery Hunt is a
      puzzlehunt competition that takes place on the MIT campus every year during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
      weekend. The hunt challenges each participating team to solve a large number of puzzles which lead to an object
      (called a “coin”) hidden somewhere on campus.” The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Mystery_Hunt"
        target="mystwiki">Wikipedia page</a> provides a more comprehensive description of the
      competition and its rich history. The puzzles are quite challenging and extremely well thought out, stacking
      layers of complexity and hidden meanings in the form of logic problems, riddles, and metas. This year's hunt
      featured hundreds of puzzles, but what stood out to me even more was the platform. Due to COVID, Mystery Hunt 2021
      had the unique
      challenge of being entirely virtual, whereas Mystery Hunts of the past were on-campus events which had teams
      exploring MIT campus and solving some of
      the puzzles, which required physical props/setup, in person.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This year's Mystery Hunt organizers (<a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/two-hundred-puzzles/"
        target="galactic">✈✈✈
        Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈</a>: the winning team of last year's Mystery Hunt, as
      per tradition) more than rose to the challenge; really, they exceeded all my expectations.
      They recreated an alternate-universe MIT (⊥IW- Perpendicular Institute of the World) as an MMO game which
      integrated with the puzzles nicely; the interactivity, explorability, creativity, and attention to detail
      of the world they built is truly astounding. But don't take my word for it, you can <a
        href="https://perpendicular.institute/" target="perp">check out ⊥IW yourself here</a>!
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Though I'm very much a puzzlehunt novice, I was fortune that my friend Mindren invited me to join the team NES,
      started last year by some MIT Next House residents. The team was fairly large and included some seasoned
      puzzlehunt
      veterans and huge brains. At least one member has written his own puzzlehunts, one of which Mindren and I did
      later in IAP. NES used Discord to
      collaborate on puzzles throughout the weekend, and maybe I'm just a Discord noob, but I was blown away by how
      streamlined and efficient the NES Discord was.
      Voice channels were created for each puzzle, so you could see what puzzles other people were actively working on
      when you
      hopped onto the server. Discord bots automatically created Google Docs for new puzzles, and you could easily ping
      other puzzlers and tag
      puzzles. Though I solved very few puzzles myself, I had a great time, and NES ended up solving over 170 puzzles
      and finishing in 15th place!
