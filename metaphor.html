    <span class="title">A Year in Metaphor | </span> December 2022
    <hr>
    <p class="blog-post">
      <i>Hey guys, this site is going to be gone when I lose my MIT athena account in a few days.
        I created it in summer 2020 out of covid boredom and general loneliness. I have barely touched it since
        early 2021. I've changed a lot since then, but kept the site up as a fun window to the past. Now that it's about
        to be gone, I wanted to return here and come full circle. What a journey it's been.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      2022 has been by far the most turbulent year of my life, with big changes, new highs, and incredible lows. One of
      my psychological defense mechanisms is to detach and views things objectively. I like to reframe trauma as
      metaphors because they seem less personal and explicit. Metaphors can't hurt you and are vague enough to let the
      reader decide what they want to take away. So without further ado, here are some metaphors from a traumatic year.

    <!-- FOOLS GOLD -->
    <span class="subheading"> Fool's Gold</span>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This year, I graduated. I feel like recycled jewelry. MIT broke me to pieces, melted them down, and cast me into a
      new shapeâ€” the shape of person I so desperately wanted to become. But an alloy is still an alloy at the end of the
      day, and I'll never be pure gold regardless of what shape I take. There's gold in me that MIT has surfaced, but
      it's not enough, and I learned to disregard the other metals that form my identity. I lamented not being 24 karat
      rather than recognize that copper, when added to gold, makes it stronger.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      But even if MIT didn't alter my composition, altering my shape has more pervasive effects than I'd realized.
      Months out from school, my jaded weariness has transformed into boredom and a lack of direction. At best, I'd call
      this ambition; at worst, Stockholm Syndrome. Complacency is more unsettling than I had anticipated, and I find
      myself yearning to want things, but not yet knowing what those things exactly are. You can either be happy or
      hungry, but what does it mean to be full? When the arena is ill-defined, the goals are self-defined, and the
      question of how to live well frequently weighs on my mind. Seeking the answer, however, appears to be a lifelong
      journey, and one I've only just begun.

    <!-- TIME SERIES -->
    <span class="subheading"> Time Series </span>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This year, I moved to NYC. I had to relearn how to make friends from scratch. Good friends are one of life's
      greatest treasures; however, there's merit in enjoying time spent alone and investing in meaningful connections
      over company for the sake of company. But how do you discern the former from the latter? Relationships are very
      multidimensional, so let's throw <a target="l"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">PCA
      </a> at it.
      Good relationships rely on enjoying each other's company, so I've identified the principal components as follows:
      (x) how much you enjoy their company and (y) how much they enjoy your company. Conveniently, this decomposition
      abstracts away the actual reasons for enjoyment (or lack thereof), which vary by individual. Using this system,
      you can plot anybody wrt their relationship to you.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/blogs/people1.png" style="width: 60%;" alt="2D plot of people you know"><br>
    <p class="blog-post">
      But this view doesn't provide the full picture. Assuming we all start as strangers, how does your best friend
      become your best friend? We're missing another axis here: (z) time. Relationships are dynamic, so they're better
      modeled as a time series than an individual point; they live in 3-D space. So a cross-sectional slice along the
      z-axis provides a 2-D snapshot of your relationships at that point in time.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/blogs/people2.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="3D plot of relationships"><br>
    <p class="blog-post">
      So to answer the original question: which relationships should we invest in? Learning how to discern relationships
      makes it simple to decide which ones to invest in. Abstractly, investing in a relationship means spending time to
      move it in the positive x and y directions. Concretely how to move in this direction is the hard part and varies
      by individual.
      Knowing that relationships are dynamic provides a peace of mind that naturally, it's natural if the people closest
      to you today aren't the people closest to you in a few years. Relationships ebb and flow, so the best we can do is
      to discern the fulfilling ones, know how to invest in them, and recognize when to let go.

    <!-- BIRTHDAY CAKE -->
    <span class="subheading"> Birthday Cake </span>
    <p class="blog-post">
      This year, I made my own birthday cake. I'd never baked a proper cake before, but I cooked a lot when I first
      moved. Cooking was a productive anesthetic, occupying my time and mind to protect it from the thoughts that might
      otherwise seep in. In the past when life got difficult, I turned to art as an escape. But this year brought
      problems an order of magnitude above anything I'd faced before, and it's hard to muster the vulnerability and
      cogency to make art when you're in the thick of drowning.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      In April, a friend gifted me a copy of Michelle Zauner's Crying in Hmart, a memoir honoring Zauner's late mother,
      documenting a mercurial mother-daughter relationship spanning cultures. Zauner highlights the way food could
      bridge that divide, binding us to memories and parts of our identities.
      The memoir resonated on many levels, its themes of misunderstanding and cancer painfully familiar this past year.
      I felt less alone reading it. Though I don't have the same nostalgic attachment to food as Zauner, even the labor
      of cooking and putting nutritious food on the table is itself a love language, even if the food doesn't taste
      good. And if food is indeed a vessel for memories and identity, I hope the friends who tasted my birthday cake
      could also taste my gratitude for them and the pain of my year baked into each slice.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post"> Well, metaphorically. It probably tasted like cake.</p>

    <!-- AFTERWORD -->
    <span class="subheading"> On Adulting (afterword)</span>
    <p class="blog-post">
      What does it mean to be an adult? This year taught me that being an adult is less about navigating taxes and
      paying rent than navigating difficult situations and taking accountability for your decisions. Growing up is the
      realization that the adults and authority figures in your life are just fallible people too, and sometimes you
      need to be the bigger person. It's the understanding that others can't purchase equity in your life. The times
      when only you can save yourself will only become more frequent. Adulthood is like drowning without lifeguards,
      either you sink or you swim.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who has helped me grow as a person. It's a privilege to have you
      in my life. Looking forward to more growth in 2023.
