      <i>This blog, like me, is a work-in-progress. I wrote this blog after finishing undergrad @ MIT in 2.5 semesters. Now that I've graduated with my master's a year later, I'm distilling my thoughts and will complete this blog soon! Last update: <b>Feb 2021</b></i>
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Like <a target="a" href="https://registrar.mit.edu/stats-reports/degrees-awarded">~40% of MIT undergraduates</a>,
      I majored
      in Course 6 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science), particularly, 6-3 Computer Science and
      Engineering. It’s feasible and not uncommon for
      students to complete their
      CS degree in under 4 years, allowing them to take a semester off to intern or study abroad, pick up another
      major/minor, graduate early, or graduate with both Bachelors and Masters degrees in 4 years. Speaking from
      personal
      experience, it turns out that it’s possible to graduate from MIT with a 6-3 degree in 2.5 years, and potentially a
      <a target="b" href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-p-meng-program">Masters
        of
        Engineering (MEng)</a> in 3 years, though I now plan to take 3.5 years (see <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for
      previous plan). <b>I don’t believe
        graduating
        early is necessarily a goal to strive towards, but rather a personal choice based on the priorities of the
        individual.</b> I still don’t know whether I made the <i>right</i> choice, or whether there is such thing as
      <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i>
      among ambiguous-but-good alternatives (<i>the grass is always greener...</i>). But what I do know
      is I’ve
      received many
      questions about scheduling advice and graduating early over the years, so I decided to record notes and
      reflections
      in a blog post. I’ve found past students’ blogs on similar topics to be very helpful, so I hope
      that the following provides useful insights and resources, regardless of whether you intend to graduate
      early. Fair warning, much of this article is tailored towards Course 6.

      Let’s start with the basics. Any <a target="c"
        href="http://catalog.mit.edu/mit/undergraduate-education/general-institute-requirements/">MIT Bachelors of
        Science (SB) Degree</a> requires 17 General Institute Requirement
      (GIR) classes, including 8 Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) classes.
      For the department you are majoring in, you need to take <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/curriculum2017">180-198
        units beyond the GIRs</a>. Course 6 undergraduates can apply
      for the <a target="d"
        href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-p-meng-program/requirements-admissions">Masters
        of
        Engineering (MEng)</a>
      program,
      which requires an additional 6 classes, thesis (2+ semesters of research), and industry internship. For
      current
      MIT students, <a target="e" href="https://eecsis.mit.edu/degree_requirements.cgi">here is a better site</a> for
      figuring out which classes satisfy which Course 6 requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      <b>Below are the classes I took and plan to take.</b> For simplicity, I’ve only listed class numbers, but you can
      find
      the <a target="f" href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/index.cgi">class descriptions here</a> and <a target="g"

      provide more detailed and candid subject evaluations on Course 6 classes

        href="https://courseroad.mit.edu/">CourseRoad</a> and <a target="j"
        href="https://fireroad.mit.edu/">FireRoad</a> are other

    <p class="blog-post">
      To preface the following discussion, it's important to remember that there is an extremely wide
      range of skills and backgrounds among students entering MIT. Personally, I started college with little CS
      experience beyond AP CS, and science fairs and math competitions were practically unheard of at my high school.
      MIT is hard, but you definitely don't need genius or pedigree to succeed. And <a target="admissions"
        href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/">MIT Admissions Blogs</a> can sometimes
      exaggerate how hard it is, relative to the average MIT student. Everyone's experiences and limits are different,
      but there exists a toxic mindset that it's imperative to bite off more than you can chew because <i>someone
        else</i> is taking N
      classes. As you can see, my schedules for most semesters were relatively reasonable, but I never felt like I
      could've taken on
      much more.
      <a name="ap_ase"></a>
      So just remember: <b>respect your own limits, take care of yourself, and
        make sure you are still learning</b>. It's okay to drop classes and change plans because, if this blog post
      provides any assurance, it's that you can still graduate on time within 4 years.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      <span class="subsubheading"> AP and ASE Credit</span><br>
      MIT is rather stingy about <a target="k"
        href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/ap-and-transfer-credit/advanced-placement">awarding credit
        for AP tests</a>. As of 2020, the only STEM GIR credit
      you can get through AP is 8.01 Physics I (Mechanics), if you score 5's on both AP Physics C exams. You can get
      credit for 18.01 Calculus (Single Variable) by passing the math diagnostic test during orientation week, provided
      you already scored a 5 on AP Calculus BC. <a name="iap_hass"></a>
      MIT also
      offers
      <a target="l"
        href="https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/ap-and-transfer-credit/advanced-standing-exams">Advanced
        Standing Exams (ASE)</a> as an option to test out of STEM GIRs. The best time to take ASEs is during
      orientation week, since they are graded P/NR. ASEs are supposed to be equivalent to final exams, and there's
      really
      no harm in trying an ASE as a prefrosh, besides stress and sacrificing a few hours of orientation week.
      To prepare
      for an ASE, I suggest <b>reviewing the class lectures, assignments, and practice exams on
        <a target="l" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">OpenCourseWare (OCW)</a> and <a target="m"
          href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/mitx-courses-edx">MITx</a></b>. I personally took 8.02, 7.012, and 6.0001 ASE, 
        and I found the above resources to be enough to pass. For 6.0001 and 7.012, I especially recommend the lectures (with exercises!) on MITx, and for 8.02,
        the MITx lectures are not complete, but you can find the rest of the content on Youtube/OCW. 
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      <span class="subsubheading"> IAP and HASS</span><br>
      <a target="m" href="https://web.mit.edu/iap/">Independent Activities Period (IAP)</a> is MIT's January term where
      students can take classes, enter competitions, work externships, teach abroad, or just chill. Since a lot of the
      IAP classes are special subjects which offer only elective credit, if you really want to knock out classes over
      IAP, you should consider taking a HASS. There is a 12 unit credit limit for IAP, but you can always enroll in
      other
      classes as
      listener (not taking for grade/credit). I took Chinese I over IAP, which gave me the same HASS credit as the
      regular semester class, at the cost of cramming an entire semester's worth of material into one month. The class
      met daily for 3 hours, and homework took about 2 hours per day. I continued taking Chinese II - IV the following
      semesters, fulfilling my HASS concentration. Growing up, my parents refused to send me to
      Chinese school, and we spoke Cantonese not Mandarin, so learning Mandarin and basic reading/writing was a really
      meaningful part of my college education. Language HASS classes require a bit more time commitment than some other
      HASS classes,
      but MIT's Chinese language classes are well-taught, and the instructors are very
      kind and reasonable.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      IAP is also a great time to knock out PE classes (4 required). I took Badminton (highly recommend) and Zumba
      during my second IAP. I also took <a target="n" href="https://weblab.mit.edu/">web.lab</a> on listener during my
      first IAP. It's also a huge time commitment class, but you definitely get out what you put in. 
      Web.lab taught me
      to love web development and building <i>things</i>, and how to not be useless at hackathons. It's honestly one
      of my favorite classes and probably also the reason this website exists. Other popular
      project-and-competition-based IAP programming
      classes include <a target="o" href="https://pokerbots.org/">Pokerbots</a> (which I took this past IAP!)
      and
      <a target="p" href="https://battlecode.org/">Battlecode</a>. Other cool IAP opportunities include <a target="q"
        href="https://capd.mit.edu/announcements/fall-and-iap-micro-internships-replace-mit-externships-program">externships</a>
      (month-long internships) and teaching
      abroad
      through <a target="r" href="https://misti.mit.edu/global-teaching-labs">MISTI GTL</a>, though you probably
      need to apply early in the fall semester to be considered for
      these
      opportunities.

      <span class="subsubheading"> Job Hunt</span><br>
      A significant time commitment and potential source of anxiety not captured in the table above is related to jobs:
      either working as
      course staff (TA/LA/grader/tutor), or looking for a job for summer or full-time. With regards to
      working as course staff, it's a good way to give back to a class you enjoyed, get paid, and help secure a TA-ship
      in future
      semesters (especially important to <b>plan ahead </b>if you want a <a
        href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-p-meng-program/financing">funded
        MEng</a>). Various types of course staff include grader, lab assistant (LA), and teaching
      assistant (TA), with increasing time commitment for each. Some classes will reach out to you to be a
      grader/LA/TA if you did well in the class. There is also a semesterly <a target="TA"
        href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/graduate-program/financial-support/teaching-assistantships">EECS
        TA application form</a>,
      or
      you could email an instructor directly if you are interested in a position. Similarly, <a target="tutor"
        href="https://hkn.mit.edu/">tutoring Course
        6 classes
        for HKN </a> is another way to help students and earn money during the semester. I was an LA for 6.004 and 6.009
      in
      2019. It
      is fulfilling to help students
      get unstuck during office hours (OH), but frankly, LAs are glorified debuggers, and keep in mind that
      reviewing
      material and staffing OH is a weekly time commitment to be factored into your schedule. I also volunteer tutored
      for HKN. The 1:1 tutoring was a nice change of pace, and you can afford to go more in-depth since there's no
      queue of students waiting to be helped.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">
      To address the latter concern of job interviews, all I can say is take 6.006 and 6.009, have some
      personal coding projects to talk about, and most importantly, <a target="s"
        href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/top-100-liked-questions/"> practice Leetcode</a>.
      Interviews take time, so reserve time in your
      schedule proportional to the number of companies you're applying for, and remember you only need (and
      can only accept) one offer at the end of the day. And once you land one internship, you'll likely have the option
      to avoid the next interview season if you decide to return to the company. This is not recommended, but at least
      you won't be jobless in any case, which helps alleviate some pressure. Another thing I'd like to address is
      the
      unhealthy
      pressure to secure an internship after freshman year, which is a tall order since a lot of companies don't hire
      freshmen. Freshman fall, I got <b>ghosted</b> by all the big tech companies' <a target="freshmeat"
        href="https://codepath.hackmd.io/s/B19EkfzV4">freshman-specific internship programs</a>. I
      practiced Leetcode over winter break, and in
      late January, I applied to regular software engineer (SWE) internships as c/o 2021 instead of 2022 (since I was
      planning on
      graduating early; I'm not
      encouraging dishonesty lol) and
      started getting interviews and job offers. I ended up interning at Amazon my freshman summer, and living in
      Seattle
      was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had. Looking back though, doing a <a target="t"
        href="https://misti.mit.edu/">MISTI program</a> abroad or
      a meaningful <a target="u" href="https://urop.mit.edu/">UROP
      </a> would probably have been a fulfilling experience as well, so you don't need
      to have a SWE internship to have a great freshman summer.

      <!-- I don't feel qualified to give advice about research, but I'll note some personal
      observations and opinions. Unless you would like to go to graduate school, research isn't a required part of
      the standard 6-3 pipeline. Most
      MIT students
      participate in at least one semester of <a target="u" href="https://urop.mit.edu/">Undergrad Research Opportunity
        Program (UROP)
      </a> during undergrad, but few conduct publishable research. More often than not, Course 6 UROPs just turn out to
      be engineering work. And that makes sense, since independent inquiry and novel contributions to a
      field
      require background knowledge and skills that most people don't walk into college with (but some do, and they
      end up at MIT), not to mention the fortune of finding a good mentor. These skills and knowledge
      are typically built up through coursework, reading scientific literature, and practical experience. So if you
      don't have
      requisite training or knowledge, it can be difficult to get an exciting UROP, and
      you might not even know yet what excites you. But, while there are problems associated with starting UROPs too
      early and ending up with busy work, it's also in your interest not to start too late. A good way to get your feet
      wet is to
      take advanced classes earlier, especially classes which discuss papers and have final projects involving
      independent
      investigation. This can be hard to do when you're trying to speedrun required classes. Though this should
      be obvious,
      if you're interested in research and academia, graduating early is probably not for you. -->
