      "<p>In light of the unjust deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and countless others, I joined the  <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CBLWPbOnWVm/' target='drawnTgt'>MIT Drawn Together</a> project in June 2020. As a part of Drawn Together, I accepted artwork commissions with proceeds going to organizations committed to supporting the Black community and combating systemic racism. As of July 2020, Drawn Together raised over $3,000 directly from commissions and was featured on <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CCZEC9rAlt2/' target='drawnTgt'>MIT's official instagram</a>.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>On the last day of my first semester of college, I took a detour from my usual path between classes and ended up stumbling upon <a href='http://cranes.mit.edu/about' target='cranes'>Collier's Cranes</a>, a beautiful installation/hack honoring the late Officer Sean Collier. Relieved to be done with a very, very long semester, I recall pausing under the cranes to savor the light pouring in from the skylight. In that moment, I felt free as a bird.</p> <p>Less than a week prior, I had been busy with the <a href='http://adt.mit.edu/' target='ADT'>Asian Dance Team (ADT)</a> end-of-semester showcase. Throughout the semester, I had gone to weekly rehearsals as a part of the ADT group performing <ahref='https://youtu.be/MNCBfjJAWA8' target='PickMe'>Pick Me</a>, but I hadn’t gotten the chance to see other ADT groups perform. At showcase, I was mesmerized by the sheer beauty and grace of the groups doing <a href='https://youtu.be/U3Mf8KR7490'target='dance'>traditional Asian dance</a>.</p><p>Inspired by these two experiences, I decided to paint something. I had recently bought a graphics tablet and was itching to try it out. Studying for finals gave me the perfect excuse to procrastinate.</p><p>It took some experimentation with posing to get the dancer’s form to resemble an origami crane. Though this piece took me forever (Photoshop is not intuitive tbh), I am satisfied with how my first digital painting turned out!</p>",
